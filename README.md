# Space Junk Tracker
<<<<<<< HEAD

This project tracks the positions of space junk and other satellites in real time using TLE data from [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.com), and [PySgp4](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/) to calculate positions from orbital elements. It then displays the positions in a real-time 3d visualisation with [PyVista]("https://docs.pyvista.org"). Satellite density is calculated and each point is color-coded depending on the density of satellites around it.

Based on this NASA spaceapps challenge:
